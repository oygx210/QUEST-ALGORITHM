# QUEST-ALGORITHM
This depository deals with a popular algorithm called "Quaternion Estimator" or often abbreviated as "QUEST" used widely in satellites for the determination of their "orientation" or more appropriately, their "Attitude" w.r.t. a reference frame. 

The program runs in a loop for as long as you want.
Press '-1' when asked to exit the loop.

Inputs:
1) The number of vectorial pairs available.
2) Vectors in both body and reference frames.
3) Weightage of each vector.

Output: Quaternion form of the attitude of satellite.
